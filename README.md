Stock_Prediction: RNN + LTSM
This project is a basic attempt to predict stock prices using different types of neural networks, specifically Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). As someone who's still new to coding and data science, this notebook serves as my learning ground for exploring machine learning concepts and experimenting with these models. Iâ€™m aware there's a lot of room for improvement, so any feedback or suggestions are more than welcome!
